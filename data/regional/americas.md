---

## United States

### Business Culture
The US market is direct, ROI-focused, and moves faster than most global markets. American buyers value efficiency, clear value propositions, and measurable outcomes.

- Direct communication is expected and appreciated -- get to the point quickly
- ROI is the primary decision driver for business stakeholders
- Pilot-first approach is extremely common: "Let us start small and prove value"
- Innovation and being "first to market" resonates as a buying motivation
- Reference customers from recognizable brands carry significant weight
- Executive engagement (VP+ level) accelerates deals significantly

### Decision-Making
- Faster decision cycles than EMEA or APAC (2-4 months for mid-market, 4-8 for enterprise)
- Multiple stakeholders but decisions can be made without full consensus
- Champion + Economic Buyer alignment is often sufficient to close
- Procurement processes vary widely -- startups have minimal process, Fortune 500 have extensive
- Security review (SOC 2 is table stakes) can add 2-4 weeks to any enterprise deal

### Communication Style
- Email and LinkedIn for outreach; phone calls are acceptable for warm leads
- Meetings should be time-boxed and agenda-driven
- Follow up promptly -- delayed responses signal disinterest
- Presentations should lead with business impact, not technical details
- US buyers appreciate competitive comparisons and want to know "Why you vs the alternative?"

## Canada

### Business Culture
Canadian business culture is similar to the US but more conservative and consensus-oriented. Quebec has distinct French-language and cultural considerations.

- More conservative evaluation processes than US -- fewer impulsive decisions
- Consensus-building is more valued than in the US
- Government procurement follows formal RFP processes via BuyAndSell.gc.ca
- Canadian companies appreciate local references and Canada-specific case studies
- Bilingual considerations are legally mandated for federal government dealings

### Quebec Specifics
- French is the official language of business in Quebec (Bill 96)
- Marketing materials, contracts, and product UI should be available in French for Quebec customers
- Quebec businesses may require French-language support
- Cultural style is more relationship-oriented than English Canada, similar to French business norms

### Pricing
- CAD billing is preferred for Canadian entities; USD is acceptable for Canadian subsidiaries of US companies
- Canadian dollar pricing should not be a direct conversion -- consider purchasing power parity
- Government contracts have specific pricing disclosure requirements
- Multi-year agreements are common in Canadian enterprise and government

## Latin America (LATAM)

### Business Culture
LATAM markets are relationship-driven, with personal connections playing a central role in business decisions. Trust is built through repeated interactions and personal rapport.

- Relationships precede transactions -- invest in personal connections before pitching
- Business meetings often start with personal conversation (family, sports, culture)
- In-person meetings are strongly preferred for deal closing, especially in Brazil and Mexico
- Business cards are exchanged formally; first meetings establish rapport, not deal terms
- Hierarchy matters -- engage appropriate seniority levels for each conversation

### Key Markets

#### Brazil
- Largest LATAM market with significant enterprise opportunity
- Portuguese language is mandatory for business communications
- Complex tax system (ICMS, ISS, PIS/COFINS) affects pricing and billing
- Strong preference for local data processing
- Longer payment terms expected (Net-60 to Net-90 common)
- Business culture is warm and relationship-focused; patience is essential

#### Mexico
- Second-largest LATAM market; growing tech sector
- Spanish-language support is essential
- Strong ties to US business practices due to proximity and USMCA
- Government procurement follows CompraNet processes
- Decision cycles moderate (3-6 months for enterprise)
- Nearshoring trend creates growing demand for technology solutions

#### Colombia, Chile, Argentina
- Growing startup ecosystems with increasing technology adoption
- Price sensitivity is higher -- usage-based and pay-as-you-go models resonate
- Currency fluctuations (especially Argentina) require flexible pricing strategies
- English proficiency varies -- Spanish-language materials recommended
- Local references are important for credibility

### Communication Style
- Warm and personal -- cold, transactional approaches fail
- Phone and WhatsApp are primary business communication channels in many LATAM markets
- Email follow-ups should reference personal connections and shared context
- Avoid aggressive sales tactics -- they damage relationships permanently
- Patience with timelines is essential; deadlines are more flexible than in the US

## Pricing and Commercial

### Regional Pricing
- Currency: USD standard for Americas region; CAD for Canada; BRL/MXN for local LATAM deals
- Pricing modifier: 1.0x (Americas pricing is the global baseline)
- US contract terms: Annual or multi-year contracts with net-30 payment terms standard
- LATAM payment terms: Net-60 to Net-90 is common; shorter terms may lose deals
- Multi-year discounts: Common and expected; 10-15% discount for 3-year commitments

### LATAM Pricing Considerations
- USD pricing is acceptable for most enterprise LATAM deals
- Local currency pricing may be required for government contracts
- Currency volatility (especially ARS, BRL) requires pricing review cadence
- Usage-based pricing strongly preferred over large upfront commitments
- Free or low-cost pilot programs accelerate adoption in price-sensitive markets

## Common Objections and Responses

### "We need SOC 2 / FedRAMP before we can proceed" (US)
**Response:** Share your SOC 2 Type II report under NDA. For FedRAMP, clarify your authorization status and timeline. If not yet FedRAMP authorized, discuss your GovCloud or FISMA-equivalent controls.

### "We need to run this through our security team" (US/Canada)
**Response:** Provide your security questionnaire responses (SIG/CAIQ), SOC 2 report, penetration test summary, and architecture diagram proactively. Offer a meeting between your security team and theirs.

### "The pricing does not work for our market" (LATAM)
**Response:** Discuss usage-based pricing that scales with their business. Offer a pilot program at reduced cost. Highlight multi-year discount structures. Consider LATAM-specific pricing tiers if deal volume justifies it.

### "We need local language support" (Quebec/LATAM)
**Response:** Confirm your language support capabilities. For Quebec, ensure French-language UI and documentation availability. For LATAM, confirm Spanish/Portuguese support channels and response times.

### "We prefer a US/local vendor" (all Americas)
**Response:** Highlight your Americas-based team, US data centers, and local customer references. For LATAM, emphasize local partnership or reseller channel presence.

### "Can we start with a pilot?" (US)
**Response:** Embrace the pilot approach. Define clear success criteria, timeline (30-60 days), and conversion terms upfront. Ensure the pilot stakeholders include the Economic Buyer's priorities, not just technical validation.
