# BANT Sales Qualification Framework

BANT is a classic sales qualification framework originally developed at IBM. It provides a quick, structured approach to determine whether a prospect is worth pursuing by evaluating four key dimensions: Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline.

**When to use BANT:** Faster deals with shorter sales cycles (1-3 months), deal values under $50K, fewer stakeholders, and less formal procurement. Ideal for SDR/BDR prospecting and initial qualification. For complex enterprise deals, transition to MEDDIC after initial BANT qualification.

**BANT vs MEDDIC:** BANT is a lightweight qualifier; MEDDIC is a deep qualification and deal management framework. Use BANT to decide if a deal is worth pursuing. Use MEDDIC to manage and win the deal once qualified.

## B - Budget

Determine whether the prospect has financial resources allocated or allocable for this purchase. Modern BANT treats budget as "is this a funded initiative?" rather than "do you have money?"

### Key Discovery Questions
- "Is this initiative part of a funded project or business priority?"
- "How does your organization typically fund new technology investments?"
- "What budget range are you working within for this type of solution?"
- "Has budget been formally allocated, or would it need to be requested?"
- "What is the cost of the current solution or manual process you are replacing?"

### Modern Budget Qualification
Budget qualification has evolved. Instead of asking "What is your budget?" (which gets defensive responses), focus on:
- **Funded initiative:** Is there a project or priority this maps to?
- **Cost of status quo:** What are they spending today on the problem (manual effort, lost revenue, existing tools)?
- **ROI payback:** If you can show payback within the budget cycle, budget becomes findable
- **Budget source:** OpEx vs CapEx, departmental vs centralized IT budget

### Practical Example
**Good approach:** "Is reducing billing errors a funded priority for this quarter, or would you need to build a business case to request budget? I ask because timing the proposal correctly matters."
**Why it works:** Determines funding status without putting the prospect on the defensive.

### Tips
- Ask about the cost of the status quo to frame your solution as savings, not expense
- If no budget exists, help the champion build a business case to secure it
- In early-stage companies, budget flexibility is higher -- focus on ROI payback period
- "We do not have budget" often means "we have not prioritized this" -- uncover the real blocker

## A - Authority

Identify who has decision-making authority for this purchase. Authority means the ability to sign off on budget, approve vendors, and execute contracts.

### Key Discovery Questions
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What is the approval process for a purchase of this size?"
- "Have you made a similar purchasing decision before?"
- "Who would sign the contract if we move forward?"
- "Is there a committee or review board that evaluates new vendors?"

### Authority Mapping
Authority is rarely a single person. Map the full decision landscape:
- **Decision Maker:** Signs the contract and approves the budget
- **Influencers:** Technical evaluators, end users, consultants who shape the recommendation
- **Gatekeepers:** Procurement, legal, security teams who can block but not approve
- **Champions:** Internal advocates who push the deal forward

### Practical Example
**Good approach:** "For technology purchases in this range, what does the approval chain look like? I want to provide the right materials for each stakeholder."
**Why it works:** Asks about process, not person, and offers value in return.

### Tips
- Never ask "Are you the decision-maker?" -- it is confrontational and unproductive
- In consensus-driven organizations, authority is shared -- map all stakeholders
- Authority for tech purchases often sits with finance, not the end user
- If your contact says "I just need to run it by my team," there are additional decision-makers

## N - Need

Understand the specific business need or problem the prospect is trying to solve. Need goes beyond "nice to have" to "must solve now."

### Key Discovery Questions
- "What specific problem are you trying to solve?"
- "How is this problem impacting your business today?"
- "What triggered you to look for a solution now?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this?"
- "What happens if this problem is not addressed in the next 6 months?"

### Need Qualification Levels
Not all needs are equal. Qualify the strength of the need:
1. **Latent need:** Customer is unaware of the problem or its magnitude
2. **Acknowledged need:** Customer recognizes the problem but has not prioritized solving it
3. **Active need:** Customer is actively seeking a solution and evaluating options
4. **Urgent need:** Customer has a deadline, trigger event, or consequence driving immediate action

Only levels 3 and 4 reliably convert to closed deals within a quarter.

### Practical Example
**Good approach:** "You mentioned launching usage-based pricing next quarter. What happens to the launch timeline if the charging infrastructure is not ready? What is the revenue impact of a delay?"
**Why it works:** Ties need to a real business deadline with measurable consequences.

### Tips
- Event-triggered needs (new exec, competitive threat, regulation) are stronger than wish lists
- Ask "What triggered you to look for a solution now?" to understand urgency drivers
- If the prospect cannot articulate business impact, the need may not be strong enough to close
- Differentiate between a need (must solve) and a want (nice to have)

---

## T - Timeline

Establish when the prospect needs the solution implemented and what events or deadlines drive that timeline.

### Key Discovery Questions
- "When do you need this solution in place?"
- "What is driving that timeline?"
- "Are there external deadlines (regulatory, contractual, seasonal)?"
- "What is the consequence of missing that deadline?"
- "How long did your last technology implementation take?"

### Timeline Validation
A real timeline is anchored to a business event:
- **Contract expiration:** Current vendor contract ends on a specific date
- **Regulatory deadline:** Compliance requirement with a legal due date
- **Product launch:** New offering launching that requires infrastructure
- **Fiscal year:** Budget expires at end of fiscal period
- **Competitive pressure:** Competitor launched something and customer is losing deals

Timelines without business anchors ("sometime next year") usually slip.

### Practical Example
**Good approach:** "Your current vendor contract expires in June. Working backward from a June go-live, we would need to start implementation by March. Does that work with your team's availability?"
**Why it works:** Anchors to a real deadline and works backward to create a concrete plan.

### Tips
- Work backward from go-live date to create a mutual action plan with milestones
- "No rush" = this deal will probably not close this quarter
- Regulatory deadlines and contract expirations are the strongest timeline drivers
- Always ask about the consequence of missing the deadline to validate urgency

## BANT Quick-Qualification Scorecard

For each dimension, rate the prospect as Strong, Moderate, or Weak:

| Dimension | Strong | Moderate | Weak |
|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| Budget | Funded initiative, budget allocated | Priority but budget not yet allocated | No budget, exploratory only |
| Authority | Direct access to decision-maker | Access through internal coach | No visibility into decision-maker |
| Need | Active evaluation, business impact quantified | Problem acknowledged, no quantification | Latent or vague need |
| Timeline | Event-driven deadline within 90 days | General timeline within 6 months | No timeline, "sometime next year" |

**Qualification threshold:** Pursue deals with 3+ Strong/Moderate ratings. Nurture or deprioritize deals with 2+ Weak ratings.
