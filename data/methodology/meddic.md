# MEDDIC Sales Qualification Framework

MEDDIC is the gold-standard enterprise sales qualification methodology, developed at PTC in the 1990s. It provides a rigorous, repeatable framework for understanding complex B2B deals by mapping the customer's buying process, identifying key stakeholders, and quantifying business impact.

**When to use MEDDIC:** Complex enterprise deals with multiple stakeholders, long sales cycles (3-12+ months), deal values above $50K, and formal procurement processes.

## M - Metrics

Metrics are the quantifiable measures of business impact your solution delivers. Without metrics, your deal lacks urgency and executive sponsorship.

### Why Metrics Matter
- Metrics translate technical features into business outcomes that justify budget allocation
- They create urgency by attaching dollar amounts to the customer's pain
- The Economic Buyer makes decisions based on metrics, not feature lists
- Metrics are the foundation of your ROI story and business case

### Key Discovery Questions
- "What KPIs are you currently measured on?"
- "How would you quantify the cost of the current problem?"
- "What improvement targets has leadership set for this initiative?"
- "If we could solve this, what would the revenue impact be in the first year?"
- "What is the cost per hour/day when this problem occurs?"
- "What efficiency gains would justify the investment to your CFO?"

### Practical Example
**Scenario:** Selling billing automation to a telecom company with 2M subscribers.
**Good approach:** "Based on your 2M subscriber base and $3.50 average cost per billing error, automating dispute resolution could save $2.1M annually. What does your finance team see as the breakeven timeline?"
**Why it works:** Uses the customer's own numbers to quantify impact and invites the customer to validate the math.

### Common Pitfalls
- Using industry averages instead of the customer's own data
- Presenting metrics as absolute claims rather than collaborative estimates
- Forgetting to tie metrics to the Economic Buyer's personal objectives
- Skipping metrics because "the customer already knows they have a problem"

### Tips
- Always use the customer's own numbers, not industry averages
- Build a simple ROI model early and refine it with your Champion
- Metrics should map to the Economic Buyer's compensation objectives
- If the customer cannot quantify the pain, the deal may not be real yet

## E - Economic Buyer

The Economic Buyer is the person with final authority to approve budget and sign the purchase order. This is not necessarily the most senior person, but the one who controls the specific budget line item.

### Why the Economic Buyer Matters
- Deals without Economic Buyer access stall or die in procurement
- The EB validates that the investment aligns with business priorities
- EB engagement signals executive sponsorship and budget commitment
- Getting EB alignment early prevents late-stage surprises

### Key Discovery Questions
- "Who has the final sign-off authority for this purchase?"
- "Who controls the budget line item this would fall under?"
- "What is the approval process once your team makes a recommendation?"
- "Has this person approved similar purchases in the past?"
- "Who can kill this deal?"

### Practical Example
**Scenario:** Identifying the Economic Buyer in an enterprise deal.
**Good approach:** "Who signs the purchase order for technology investments in your revenue operations group? I want to make sure we address their priorities in our proposal."
**Why it works:** Asks about process authority (who signs) while showing respect for the contact's role.

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing the most senior person with the actual budget holder
- Going directly to the EB without your Champion's introduction
- Presenting a technical demo to the EB instead of an executive briefing
- Assuming the person who initiated the evaluation has budget authority

### Tips
- The EB is defined by budget authority, not org chart position
- Ask "Who can say no?" to identify veto power holders
- Get your Champion to arrange EB access -- never go around them
- Prepare a concise executive briefing focused on business outcomes, not features

## D - Decision Criteria

Decision Criteria are the formal and informal criteria the customer uses to evaluate and compare vendors. This includes technical requirements, business requirements, and cultural fit.

### Why Decision Criteria Matter
- If you discover criteria late, a competitor has likely already set them
- If you help define the criteria, you significantly increase your win rate
- Understanding criteria lets you emphasize your strengths and mitigate weaknesses
- Decision criteria often change during evaluations -- you need to track them

### Key Discovery Questions
- "What criteria will you use to evaluate potential solutions?"
- "How are you weighting technical vs business vs cost factors?"
- "Are there any must-have requirements that would eliminate a vendor?"
- "Has your team already created an RFP or evaluation scorecard?"
- "Who defines the evaluation criteria -- IT, business, or procurement?"

### Practical Example
**Scenario:** Understanding decision criteria for a charging platform evaluation.
**Good approach:** "When you evaluated your current billing system three years ago, what were the top three criteria? How have your priorities shifted with the move to usage-based pricing?"
**Why it works:** Uncovers evolving criteria tied to real business change rather than dumping features.

### Tips
- Help your Champion add criteria where your solution is strongest
- Technical criteria are table stakes; business outcome criteria differentiate winners
- If procurement adds new criteria late in the process, a competitor is likely influencing them
- Revisit criteria as the evaluation progresses -- they rarely stay static

## D - Decision Process

The Decision Process is the sequence of steps, approvals, and events the customer follows to make a purchasing decision, including timeline, stakeholder sign-offs, legal review, and procurement steps.

### Why the Decision Process Matters
- Unmapped processes cause deals to slip quarter after quarter
- Legal review, security audits, and board approvals can add weeks or months
- A mutual action plan built on the decision process is your most valuable forecasting tool
- Understanding the process lets you proactively address each gate

### Key Discovery Questions
- "Can you walk me through the steps from recommendation to signed contract?"
- "What approvals are required beyond the project team's recommendation?"
- "Is there a legal or security review required for new vendors?"
- "What is your target go-live date, and what drives that timeline?"
- "Are there any budget cycle deadlines we should be aware of?"

### Practical Example
**Scenario:** Mapping the buying process for an enterprise deal.
**Good approach:** "Let me make sure I understand: your team evaluates and recommends, then VP Engineering approves, legal reviews the MSA, and procurement negotiates final terms. Is there anything I am missing? What is the typical timeline for each step?"
**Why it works:** Demonstrates understanding, invites correction, and establishes specific timelines.

### Tips
- Create a mutual action plan with your Champion mapping every step to a date
- Build in buffer time for legal and security reviews (they always take longer than expected)
- Ask about procurement holidays, budget freeze periods, and fiscal year boundaries
- If the decision process is unclear to your contact, the deal may not be real

## I - Identify Pain

Pain is the specific business problem creating urgency to act. Pain must be tied to business impact -- revenue loss, cost, risk, or competitive disadvantage -- not just technical annoyance.

### Why Identifying Pain Matters
- Pain creates urgency; without it, there is no compelling reason to buy now
- Business pain (revenue, cost, risk) resonates with Economic Buyers; technical pain does not
- The depth of pain determines the customer's willingness to pay and speed of decision
- Layered pain (technical -> business -> personal) is the most powerful motivator

### Key Discovery Questions
- "What is the biggest challenge with your current approach?"
- "How is this problem affecting your team's productivity?"
- "What happens if you do nothing and this persists for another year?"
- "How does this impact your customers' experience?"
- "What have you tried so far to solve this?"
- "Is the problem getting worse, staying the same, or improving?"
- "Who else in the organization is affected?"

### Practical Example
**Scenario:** Identifying pain in a billing transformation deal.
**Good approach:** "You mentioned billing errors cause 15% of your support tickets. Beyond support costs, help me understand the downstream impact. Are you seeing churn from customers who receive incorrect invoices?"
**Why it works:** Deepens the pain by exploring downstream business impact (churn), not just direct costs.

### Tips
- Pain must be personal -- understand how it affects the individual, not just the org
- Use "what happens if you do nothing?" to test urgency
- Layer pain: technical pain -> business pain -> personal career pain
- If there is no pain, there is no deal. Qualify out and move on.

## C - Champion

The Champion is an internal advocate who has power, influence, and a personal stake in your success. They sell internally when you are not in the room and navigate organizational politics on your behalf.

### Why the Champion Matters
- A true Champion is the single most important factor in winning enterprise deals
- They provide inside information about competing priorities, political dynamics, and objections
- Champions coach you on how to position for the Economic Buyer
- They advocate for your solution in internal meetings you cannot attend

### Key Discovery Questions
- "Who on your team is most affected by this problem day-to-day?"
- "Who stands to benefit most from solving this?"
- "Who has the credibility to make a recommendation to the decision-maker?"
- "What would a successful outcome mean for your career and team?"
- "Can you help me understand how to position this for your leadership?"

### Practical Example
**Scenario:** Testing whether your contact is a true Champion.
**Good approach:** "If I prepare an executive briefing document, would you be comfortable presenting it to your VP with your recommendation? What concerns would they raise that we should address proactively?"
**Why it works:** Tests willingness to advocate and coaches them for the internal conversation.

### How to Test Your Champion
A true Champion has three qualities:
1. **Power:** They have organizational credibility and influence
2. **Influence:** Their recommendations are taken seriously by the Economic Buyer
3. **Personal Motivation:** They benefit personally from the project's success

Test: Ask them to do something -- share internal information, arrange a meeting, present your case internally. If they decline or deflect, they may be a Coach (informative but passive) rather than a Champion (active advocate).

### Tips
- Coach your Champion on how to sell internally -- give them talking points and one-pagers
- If your Champion leaves the company, your deal is at risk. Always build multiple relationships.
- A Champion who cannot articulate your value proposition needs more coaching
- The best Champions are the ones who feel the pain most personally

## MEDDIC Deal Review Checklist

Use this checklist in deal reviews and pipeline calls:

- [ ] **Metrics:** Can the customer quantify the business impact (revenue/cost savings)?
- [ ] **Economic Buyer:** Have you identified and accessed the budget holder?
- [ ] **Decision Criteria:** Do you know the evaluation criteria and can you influence them?
- [ ] **Decision Process:** Have you mapped every step from evaluation to signed contract?
- [ ] **Identify Pain:** Is there compelling, urgent business pain driving the purchase?
- [ ] **Champion:** Do you have an internal advocate selling for you behind closed doors?

**Scoring:** Each element is Red (not identified), Yellow (partially identified), or Green (confirmed and validated). A deal with any Red elements is at risk.
