# Requirements: Agent Army Platform

**Defined:** 2025-02-10
**Core Value:** Sales Agent autonomously executing enterprise sales methodology at top-1% level - the foundation for the entire 8-agent crew

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Sales Agent + Platform Foundation to 80%+ production-ready.

### Platform Foundation

- [x] **PLT-01**: Multi-tenant architecture with schema-per-tenant isolation (Skyvera, Jigtree, Totogi)
- [x] **PLT-02**: Tenant context propagation across all components (database, vector store, LLM context, caching)
- [x] **PLT-03**: Event-driven backbone for agent coordination (Redis Streams)
- [x] **PLT-04**: Supervisor orchestration topology (not flat "bag of agents")
- [x] **PLT-05**: Agent registry and handoff protocol (how 8 agents coordinate work)
- [x] **PLT-06**: Three-tier context management (Working/Session/Memory per Google ADK pattern)
- [x] **PLT-07**: Validation checkpoints at agent handoffs (prevent cascading hallucination)
- [x] **PLT-08**: Observability infrastructure (Langfuse for debugging agent decisions)
- [x] **PLT-09**: Cost tracking per tenant per agent (token usage, API calls)
- [x] **PLT-10**: Security framework (prompt injection protection, tenant isolation validation)

### Knowledge Base

- [x] **KB-01**: Product knowledge base (Skyvera offerings, pricing, positioning)
- [x] **KB-02**: Multi-tenant vector database (Qdrant with per-tenant namespaces)
- [x] **KB-03**: Agentic RAG pipeline (query decomposition, retrieval, synthesis)
- [x] **KB-04**: Sales methodology library (MEDDIC, BANT, Target Account Selling frameworks)
- [x] **KB-05**: Regional customization data (APAC, EMEA, Americas nuances)
- [x] **KB-06**: Conversation history storage and retrieval (persistent memory across sessions)
- [x] **KB-07**: Document ingestion pipeline (add new products as ESW acquires businesses)

### Sales Agent - Core Capabilities

- [x] **SA-03**: Google Chat integration (send messages to customers and internal team)
- [x] **SA-04**: Context compilation per conversation (pull relevant account/deal/product data)
- [x] **SA-05**: Persona-based interaction (adapt tone/depth to IC, manager, exec, C-suite)
- [x] **SA-06**: Sales methodology execution - BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
- [x] **SA-07**: Sales methodology execution - MEDDIC
- [x] **SA-08**: Conversation state tracking (where we are in deal cycle, what's been discussed)
- [x] **SA-09**: Next-action recommendation (what agent should do next based on conversation signals)
- [x] **SA-10**: Escalation to human (when confidence drops or situation requires human judgment)

### Sales Agent - Meeting Capabilities

- [x] **SA-11**: Meeting briefing creation (account context, objectives, talk tracks)
- [x] **SA-12**: Google Meet attendance with meeting bot (Recall.ai)
- [x] **SA-13**: Real-time speech-to-text during meetings (Deepgram STT)
- [x] **SA-14**: Avatar representation in meetings (HeyGen LiveAvatar) — code complete, webapp deployment pending human action
- [x] **SA-15**: Real-time response generation during meetings (<800ms latency budget)
- [x] **SA-16**: Meeting recording capture and storage
- [x] **SA-17**: Meeting minutes generation (summary, action items, decisions)
- [x] **SA-18**: Automated minutes distribution to stakeholders

### Sales Agent - Deal Management

- [x] **SA-19**: Opportunity identification from conversations (budget signals, pain points, timeline)
- [x] **SA-20**: Account plan creation and maintenance (strategic view of customer relationship)
- [x] **SA-21**: Opportunity plan creation and maintenance (tactical view of specific deal)
- [x] **SA-22**: Political mapping (decision makers, influencers, champions, blockers with power dynamics)
- [x] **SA-23**: CRM integration (Notion adapter; create/update opportunities, contacts, activities)
- [x] **SA-24**: Deal stage progression (move opportunities through pipeline based on signals)

### Sales Agent - Intelligence & Autonomy

- [x] **SA-25**: Data consolidation across conversations/meetings/emails (unified view of customer)
- [x] **SA-26**: Pattern recognition within single account (e.g., "champion mentions budget freeze 3 times")
- [x] **SA-27**: Self-directed goal tracking (dollars identified, sold, average deal time, closing rate)
- [x] **SA-28**: Proactive outreach generation (identify when to follow up without human prompt)
- [x] **SA-29**: Geographic customization (different behavior for APAC, EMEA, Americas)
- [x] **SA-30**: Agent cloning system (replicate with different persona per sales rep)

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 57 of 57 v1 requirements (100%)

**Adjusted during implementation:**
- SA-23: Originally "Salesforce or HubSpot" — implemented as Notion adapter with PostgreSQL primary (CRM adapter pattern supports any future CRM)
- SA-13, SA-14, SA-15: Complete in code; SA-14 (avatar) requires human deployment action for production use
- INF-05: Google Workspace delegation code ready; credentials require production setup

**Dropped:** None — all 57 requirements shipped

**Additional requirements delivered (not in original spec):**
- Agent Learning & Performance Feedback (Phase 4.1): outcome tracking, confidence calibration, coaching patterns, analytics dashboards
- QBS Methodology Integration (Phase 4.2): Question Based Selling throughout all sales stages

**Note on count:** REQUIREMENTS.md originally stated 60 v1 requirements. Actual enumerated count is 57 (PLT-01:10 + KB-01:7 + SA-01:30 + INF-01:10). No missing requirements found — counting error in original specification.
