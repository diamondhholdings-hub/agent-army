<objective>
Create the sales-person-friendly demo guide and verify SC3 (Google Workspace), SC4 (Notion CRM), and SC5 (end-to-end demo scenario) in production. This is the final plan in the phase -- after this, all 5 success criteria are verified.

Purpose: The user decision requires the demo to be "runnable by a non-technical sales person without developer assistance." SC3-SC5 require manual verification by the developer against live production services. This plan creates the guide and facilitates the final verification.

Output: `docs/demo-guide.md` + all 5 success criteria verified.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create sales-person-friendly demo guide and SC3/SC4 verification commands</name>
  <files>docs/demo-guide.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/demo-guide.md` -- a step-by-step demo runbook designed for non-technical sales people to run the Sales Agent demo independently.

**Document structure:**

**Header:** Title, last updated date, estimated demo time (5 minutes)

**Section: Prerequisites (one-time setup)**
Checklist of things that must be true before running the demo:
- [ ] You have access to the webapp URL (provide the actual Vercel URL -- use a placeholder like `https://agent-army-meeting-bot.vercel.app` that will be updated with the real URL)
- [ ] A Google Meet meeting is scheduled with a real Skyvera prospect
- [ ] The prospect has a record in the Notion CRM deals database
- [ ] You have a stable internet connection

**Section: Running the Demo (5 minutes)**

Step 1: Start the Google Meet
1. Open Google Calendar
2. Click on the scheduled meeting with the prospect
3. Click "Join with Google Meet"
4. Wait for the prospect to join

Step 2: Invite the Sales Agent to the meeting
1. In a new browser tab, go to the webapp URL
2. Copy the Google Meet URL from the meeting (e.g., `https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij`)
3. Paste it into the "Meeting URL" field
4. Click "Join Meeting"
5. Wait approximately 10-15 seconds -- the Sales Agent avatar will appear in the meeting

Step 3: Run the qualification conversation
- The agent will introduce itself and begin the conversation
- Let the conversation flow naturally -- the agent will ask about budget, authority, need, and timeline
- The agent responds in real-time with natural conversation
- Typical demo duration: 3-5 minutes of conversation

Step 4: Verify results (after the meeting ends)
1. Check Notion CRM: Open the prospect's deal record. BANT qualification signals should be updated with information gathered during the meeting.
2. Check email: Within 5 minutes of the meeting ending, a follow-up email should be sent from the agent's email to the prospect. Check the agent email's "Sent" folder if needed.

**Section: What the Agent Does (for sales context)**
Brief, non-technical explanation:
- Joins the meeting as an AI sales assistant with a visual avatar
- Listens to the conversation and responds in real-time
- Automatically identifies and records BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) signals
- Updates the deal record in Notion CRM with gathered intelligence
- Sends a personalized follow-up email summarizing the conversation and next steps

**Section: Troubleshooting**
Common issues and fixes:
- "Avatar doesn't appear in the meeting": Verify the Google Meet URL was pasted correctly. Try refreshing the webapp page and re-joining.
- "Agent doesn't respond during the meeting": Check your internet connection. Refresh the webapp. If the issue persists, the backend may need a moment to connect -- wait 30 seconds.
- "No follow-up email received": Allow up to 5 minutes. Check the prospect's spam folder. Verify the prospect's email address is correct in the CRM.
- "CRM not updated": Allow up to 2 minutes after the meeting ends. Refresh the Notion page.

**Section: Quick Reference**
A one-line summary for returning users:
1. Open webapp -> Paste Meet URL -> Click Join -> Conversation -> Check Notion + Email

**Also create SC3/SC4 verification test commands** at the bottom of the guide in a "Developer Verification" section (marked as "For developers only -- skip if you're a salesperson"):

SC3 verification commands (Google Workspace):
```bash
# Test Gmail send (replace CLOUD_RUN_URL and JWT)
curl -X POST https://CLOUD_RUN_URL/api/v1/test/gmail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "developer@skyvera.com", "subject": "SC3 Production Test", "body": "Testing Gmail send from production agent."}'

# Test Calendar read
curl https://CLOUD_RUN_URL/api/v1/calendar/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN"
```

SC4 verification commands (Notion CRM):
```bash
# Test create record
curl -X POST https://CLOUD_RUN_URL/api/v1/deals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "SC4 Production Test Deal", "deal_stage": "prospecting", "product_line": "skyvera"}'

# Test read back
curl https://CLOUD_RUN_URL/api/v1/deals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN"
```

Note: These are template commands. The developer will fill in actual URLs and JWT tokens during verification. The exact API paths may vary based on the v1 router -- the developer should check the available endpoints.

  <verify>
Verify file exists with all sections:
- "Prerequisites" section
- "Running the Demo" section with numbered steps
- "Troubleshooting" section
- "Developer Verification" section with curl commands
- File is written in plain, non-technical language (except developer section)
  </verify>
  <done>
`docs/demo-guide.md` exists with a complete, salesperson-friendly demo runbook. A non-technical person can follow Steps 1-4 without developer assistance. Developer verification commands for SC3/SC4 are included at the bottom.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Developer verifies SC3, SC4, and SC5 in production</name>
  <what-built>
Demo guide created. Production services are live (from Plan 04). All credentials are configured (from Plan 03). The final three success criteria need manual verification by the developer.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**SC3 -- Google Workspace Integration:**
1. Use the developer verification commands in docs/demo-guide.md to test Gmail send
2. Verify the test email arrives at the developer's inbox
3. Test Calendar read to verify the agent can see calendar events
4. If the test endpoints don't exist, test via the agent's normal workflow (trigger a meeting briefing or follow-up email)

**SC4 -- Notion CRM Integration:**
1. Use the developer verification commands to create a test deal in Notion
2. Open the Notion database and verify the record appeared
3. Read the record back via the API
4. Delete the test record from Notion

**SC5 -- End-to-End Demo:**
1. Create a Google Meet with a real Skyvera prospect (or simulate with a colleague playing the prospect role)
2. Follow the demo guide (docs/demo-guide.md) exactly as a salesperson would
3. Invite the Sales Agent via the webapp
4. Run a 3-5 minute qualification conversation
5. After the meeting, verify:
   - Deal record in Notion updated with BANT signals
   - Follow-up email sent to the prospect
6. Confirm the avatar appeared and was visible during the meeting
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "all 5 SCs verified" if SC3, SC4, and SC5 pass (SC1 and SC2 were verified in Plan 04). Or describe which SC failed and what happened.</resume-signal>
