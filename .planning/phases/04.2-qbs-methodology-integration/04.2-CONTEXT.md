# Phase 4.2: QBS Methodology Integration - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Integrate Question Based Selling (QBS) methodology into the Sales Agent's conversational capabilities throughout all sales stages (outreach, discovery, qualification, proposal, closing). Use pain funnel questions, impact questions, solution questions, and confirmation questions to guide conversations naturally. Enable account expansion techniques to identify and engage multiple contacts, building multi-threaded relationships.

This phase enhances HOW the agent conducts conversations. It does not add new stages, channels, or capabilities - those belong in other phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Question deployment strategy

**How agent chooses which QBS question type:**
- **Adaptive based on signals** - Not a fixed sequence (pain → impact → solution → confirmation), but responsive to conversation context
- **Signal detection blend** - Combine three sensing modes:
  - Information gap sensing: What's missing from conversation context?
  - Customer engagement signals: Where is the customer's energy/interest?
  - Natural conversation flow: What logically follows from what they just said?
- **Balance with natural stopping points** - Probe until:
  - Customer gives clear, complete articulation
  - Customer shifts focus or topic
  - Conversation rhythm indicates it's time to move on
- **Opportunistic cycle timing** - Use QBS whenever the moment calls for it, regardless of sales stage. If impact needs clarifying in proposal stage, ask impact questions. No stage restrictions.

### Methodology blending

**Integration with BANT/MEDDIC/Chris Voss:**
- **Fully blended approach** - All methodologies work together seamlessly:
  - QBS questions extract BANT/MEDDIC data
  - Using Chris Voss empathy techniques (mirroring, labeling, calibrated questions)
  - Each question blends all three: QBS type + MEDDIC/BANT target + Voss delivery
- **Example:** Pain funnel question that identifies MEDDIC Metrics using mirroring: "It sounds like the manual process is costing you about 40 hours a week [mirror] - help me understand, what happens to your team's other priorities when they're stuck doing this work? [pain funnel + impact hybrid extracting Metrics]"
- **Priority hierarchy:** Customer engagement wins - Follow where customer's energy is. If they're revealing pain, stay with that. If they mention decision maker, explore that thread. Don't force methodology sequence over conversation flow.
- **Learning integration:** Track which blending patterns lead to best outcomes + leverage Phase 4.1 feedback infrastructure (outcome tracking, human feedback, confidence calibration) to continuously refine blending approach

### Pain funnel depth

**How deep to probe:**
- **Depth target:** Probe until BOTH:
  - Root cause or emotional driver is reached (fear, frustration, aspiration)
  - Customer themselves articulates and feels the weight of the problem
- **Recognition signals:** Agent detects emotional recognition through:
  - Explicit statements: "this is killing us", "we can't keep doing this", "I'm worried about..."
  - Tone/language shift: From factual ("it takes time") to emotional ("it's frustrating", "exhausting", "keeping me up at night")
  - Self-elaboration: Customer volunteers more detail without being asked
- **Resistance handling:** Respect their pace
  - Not every customer goes deep on first conversation
  - Note the gap, revisit later when trust builds
  - Don't force emotional disclosure
- **Pain utilization:** Use pain strategically throughout sales cycle:
  - Reference for continuity across conversations ("Remember you mentioned...")
  - Tie to solution capabilities ("This feature addresses the bottleneck you described")
  - Build urgency ("Given the cost you identified, when do you need this resolved?")
  - Inform deal prioritization (high pain = high priority)

### Account expansion approach

**Building multi-threaded relationships:**
- **Expansion triggers:** Natural conversation moments
  - Listen for when customer mentions other people ("My boss", "The team", "Finance")
  - Use that as organic entry point to expand contacts
  - Feels conversational, not transactional
- **Expansion techniques:** Multiple approaches in toolkit:
  - Direct request: "Can you introduce me to [person]?"
  - QBS-style: "How does [person] experience this problem? Would it help to understand their perspective?"
  - Value-based framing: "To ensure this solution works for [Finance], it would help to understand their requirements"
  - Voss calibrated: "How am I supposed to solve [pain] without understanding what [decision maker] needs?"
- **Resistance handling:** Multi-pronged approach:
  - Probe the hesitation: "What concerns do you have about involving [person]?"
  - Respect and revisit: Don't push, build more trust, revisit later
  - Offer alternatives: "Could I send you questions for [person] that you could ask?"
  - Assess deal risk: Hesitation may signal lack of championship or weak deal
- **Multi-threading orchestration:** All three integrated:
  - Coordinate messaging: Consistent value prop, customized to each person's role/concerns
  - Navigate politics: Use Phase 5 political mapping to understand power/influence relationships
  - Build shared narrative: Ensure everyone understands problem and solution the same way

### Claude's Discretion

- Specific LLM prompting patterns for each QBS question type
- Signal detection thresholds and confidence scoring
- Conversation state management and context assembly
- Integration architecture with existing Phase 4 SalesAgent class
- Performance optimization and caching strategies

## Specific Ideas

**Elite salesperson grounding:**
- User question: "What is the closest way that the top human salesperson would do this?"
- All QBS techniques should model top 1% sales behavior:
  - Listen actively for what customer is revealing (or NOT revealing)
  - Follow the energy - if customer lights up, probe deeper there
  - Natural conversation flow - questions emerge from what was just said, not a script
  - Gap sensing - intuitively sense what's missing and probe accordingly
  - Context over checklist - respond to the conversation, not a rigid sequence

**Methodology sophistication:**
- Each question should blend QBS structure + MEDDIC/BANT targeting + Voss empathy delivery
- Example: Pain funnel question extracting Metrics using mirroring
- Agent should make it feel consultative and human, not scripted or interrogative

None - discussion stayed within phase scope. No new capabilities or channels suggested.
