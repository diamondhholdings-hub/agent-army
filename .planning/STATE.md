## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases derived from 57 v1 requirements with dependency-driven ordering
- [Roadmap]: Multi-tenant isolation in Phase 1 (cannot be retrofitted per research)
- [Roadmap]: Async deal workflows (Phase 4-5) before real-time meetings (Phase 6)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5 and 6 can parallelize after Phase 4 completes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md states 60 v1 requirements but actual count is 57 (10 PLT + 7 KB + 30 SA + 10 INF). No missing requirements found -- likely a counting error in the original file.
